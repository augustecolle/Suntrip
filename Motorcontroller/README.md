Motorcontroller
===============

I have to read much deeper into this matter but it seems like there are basically three options:

1. Trapezoidal control
2. Sinusoidal control
3. Field oriented control (a.k.a. the best in torque control and overall efficiency)

Phaserunner
-----------

The phaserunner looks like an evident choice, small, lightweight, state of the art, wide range of voltage and current, allows regenerative breaking, allows field weakening, ...

[check it here](http://www.ebikes.ca/product-info/phaserunner.html)

Fiel weakening test:

 - 12 amps field weakening gives 60 degrees Centigrade controller temperature and 18 amps phase current at no load. Motor goes from 41 km/h to 45.6 km/h no load speed.
