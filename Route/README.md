# Route

_sun trip organisers:_
  - if there are checkpoints it will be only in China, and only if Chinese authoritories ask that.
  - pour clair et direct seuls les trois jours du prologue en France seront assistés, avec un accueil chaque soir pris en charge, et aussi pour votre arrivée à Canton.


At this time, we aim at holding the official departure in Lyon on June 15 or 16 (this is provisional information).

Then we should spend 3-4 days together on a prologue:
one night near the Bourget Lake (Savoie), near Aix-les-Bains & Chambéry. 
one night in the Bauges mountains (Savoie). 
one night in the Aravis mountains (Haute-Savoie), near Le Grand Bornand. To be confirmed. 
and then, the final base camp in Chamonix. 

The start proper should take place in Chamonix on June 19 or 20

## Route segments:

GraphHopper for start-finish (Chamonix - Canton)

    - distance       : 12150 km
    - elevation gain : 68882 m

Sum of indiv. segments:

    - distance       : 11941 km
    - elevation gain : 63145 m


- Chamonix - Uralsk : Graphopper, not checked

- Kazachstan : Uralsk - Zahrkent (approx. 3000km)
    - possible route through Kazachstan on what looks like paved roads all the way.
      Bicycling touring seems ok on section between Shymkent and Almaty, relatively "popular"
      No information on the other part...
      *TODO* Check if this is shorter than norther route (Graphhopper).
      
      [Road conditions](https://caravanistan.com/transport/driving/kazakhstan/)
      Overall conclusion, looks good for the most part for our route!
        - Saratov (RUS) - Urask: degraded road surface (potholes)
        - Uralsk (Oran) - Aktobe : new tarmac (2015)
        - Aqtobe - Aralsk via E38: Excellent quality tarmac. From Karabutak to Aralsk there are now at least 3 petrol stations operating between those towns. One after 112km, one near Irghiz (around 190km after Karabutak), and one at 380km.
        - Shymkent – Turkestan – Kyzylorda – Aralsk – Aqtobe: New road (2014).  Excellent quality tarmac.
        - Shymkent – Taraz – Shu – Almaty: New road (2014).
        - Saryozek – Altyn Emel – Khorgos – Urumqi: Decent.

- [Kiev-Krakow](https://www.bikemap.net/en/route/3290130-kiev-krakow-927km-1680hm/#/z11/49.9887595,20.1811981/terrain)
  From Krakow east, mainly along the national road parallel to the E40. The section between Lancut en Pryzeworst seems to be 2 lane road with no shoulder so routed along smaller roads for that small part.
  
  In Ukraine it seems people cycle on the E40 highway! Strava shows activity on the road and I spotted some on [google maps](https://www.google.be/maps/@50.0385691,25.1370347,3a,75y,14.35h,86.64t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTIjiASKU5MOwoemVcqnwdA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en), look at this [badass](https://www.google.be/maps/@50.0559231,25.1477143,3a,75y,146.42h,68.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sXR9xV-b-WOuMpLzcBXRo7Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en). After extensive google street view inspection it seems that [locals](https://www.google.be/maps/@50.1118557,25.1962285,3a,75y,167.17h,62.94t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s7tTR2epj1cqReqeXDy54yg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en) cycle on the E40 so this is probably allowed. [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1hZOart86w) of the E40 between L'viv and Kiev.
  Detours seem possible put alternative roads seem very bad and full of potholes (google maps).
  The highway in the north, E373, seems very smooth and quieter but it is a huge detour...
  
- [Shanghai - Kazachstan](https://www.bikemap.net/en/route/818839-shanghai-to-kazakhstan/#/z6/41.1124688,101.3378906/google_roadmap)


- China:
    - (K)Horgos-border crossing to Urumqi via G312/G30. Apparently highway is closed officially closed to cyclists. Several blogs mentioning ignoring signs and riding through [1](https://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/page/?page_id=82269), [2](https://brakingboundaries.org/2014/06/25/scenes-road-urumqi-zhangye/), [3](http://www.twistingspokes.com/we-cycled-to-china-everything-changed/), [4](https://ontheroadagain.travellerspoint.com/82/). In fact all posts about Almaty - Urumqi seem to take the G312/G30...
      - added GPX track using graphopper, had to set profile to cars to get track along G30 as bicycle profile will not take this...
    
    - [Xinjiang province](http://www.14degrees.org/china-xinjiang-province/) (Khorgos-border to Gansu province border). Follows G312 all the way. With description of road and accomodations along the way.
    
    - [Urumqi - Xian](https://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/?doc_id=3112) blog of Urumqi - Xian route. Mentions taking the  (toll) "express way" that runs parallel to G312 although technically no cyclists allowed.
    
    - [Xinjang, Gansu](https://cycling4cancer.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/epic-distances-through-western-china-traversing-xinjiang-gansu-and-qinghai/) mentions riding on the G30 express way instead of the parallel G312.
    
    - Wuwei - Xi'an (Liantan) : checked with Google maps (sattelite), looks asphalt all the way. Note that Wuwei - Xi'an over Lanzhou is similar in distance but has much more height meters, so going via Zhonwei en Pingliang is favoured. Looking on strava it seems that in and around Lanzhou cycling is more popular.
    
    - Xi'an (Liantan) - Denzhou : checked with Google maps sattelite view
    
    - Jingzhou (Try to take the [ferry](http://georgethecyclist.blogspot.be/2009/10/zhijang-china.html), bridge detour is approx 150 to 200 km).
    
    - Denzhou - Chenzhou : check with Google maps sattelite
    
    - Chengzhou - Guangzhou (finish) : Graphopper, not checked. Strava, not checked. Note that strava gives half the elevation gain. (How accurate is this?)

## TO DO:

1. Check the raw_route manually for forbidden border crossings, check on paved roads and check if all roads are doable with a bicycle.

## Optimization

Least relief, most sun, shortest distance, least borders to cross?

After watching Sun Trip 2013 we definitely want to prefer paved roads to unpaved ones.
Especially since dodging stones and potholes is more difficult on a trike.

## Started routing :hear_no_evil:

1. ~~Started to make a track based on the profile of a "racingbike" on [graphhopper](https://www.graphhopper.com/). This profile prefers "roads", which I interpret as paved. It is the only route planner I found which is able to plan such a long distance and it comes pretty close to the straight line in Google Earth.~~

~~I converted the track to .kml to view in Google Earth and Google Maps.~~

Problem: check the route manually for bad things as crossing the border with Belarus, manual rerouting is needed. Also some paved roads are highways, for example:

2. :smirk_cat: Made new graphhopper that starts from correct starting location: Chamonix, France
