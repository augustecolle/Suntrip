Welcome on the website about our participation in the SunTrip 2018.
We are two brothers, 
<a href='{{site.baseurl}}/about.html'>Auguste & Camille</a>
, and if everything goes according
to plan we'll be cycling from Lyon to Guangzhou this summer on a tandem recumbant
fitted with an electric motor and solar panels.

You can also checkout our presentation on the 
<a href="https://www.thesuntrip.com/auguste-camille-colle/">official SunTrip site</a>.

Below and under

you'll find regular updates on our preparation and the status of our adventure.

    We would like to thank <a href="https://www.russieautrement.com">russieautrement</a> to assist us in the rather cumbersome process of obtaining a Russian visa.
    Hopefully our <a href="https://www.russieautrement.com"> joruney through Russia</a> will go smoothly.
