We decided to cycle to Mechelen where Raf Van Hulle was organising a workshop
about the Sun Trip.  With an early start we were on the road by 6:45 AM.  It
was still dark outside when we rode along the Schelde eastbound.  Gradually the
clouded sky lighted up as we approached Dendermonde where we had a quick
pitstop at the LIDL.

From thereon out Auguste, sitting at the back, took on navigator duty and
guided us through the countryside towards Mechelen.  We were running slightly
late and after a short detour involving roadworks and passing a bakery to buy
lunch we arrived at Raf's place shortly after 10.

There we met the other Belgian particpants and sympathizers.  The info sessions
of Raf and Florian, one of the Sun Trip organisers, were very informative.  The
day quickly passed and at 6:30 PM we packed up and started our journey home.
It was already dark and a strong headwind made things harder.  To make things
worse it started raining, limiting visibility on the unlit path along the
Schelde.  Due to the lack of a rear fender Auguste's back and behind were being
showered with the cold water.

As we passed Wetteren disaster struck as Auguste sugar levels dropped and his
legs turned into spaghetti.  Luckily we quickly found a night shop and he
smashed a pint of Ben & Jerry's as we put in the final kilometers towards
Ghent.  Wet and tired we were happy to finally be home again around 10 PM.
