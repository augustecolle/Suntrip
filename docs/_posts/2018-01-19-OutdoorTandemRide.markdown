Finally the sun has decided to come out again.  Although still a bit chilly we
set out in a decent headwind along the Leie towards Kortrijk.  In Deinze we had
to carry our tandem trike accross some roadworks.  We kept riding towards the
low-hanging sun, giving us some welcome sunshine on our faces, up to about 15
km out of Kortrijk where we turned around.

With the headwind turned into a tailwind now and another cyclist in front of
us, destined to be overtaken by us we where blazing back north.  Auguste
decided to ignore his growing thirst in favor of keeping up the swift pace as
we passed Deinze.

Just as the sun was setting we rolled back into Ghent.
