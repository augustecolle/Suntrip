At 3 A.M. we gathered at the campus in Ghent to drive to lyon with the bike on a trailer.
Jack, another suntrip participant, joined us and the three of us were driven by Tom down to Lyon.


We were one of the earlier participants to arrive and after re-assembling our bikes and passing the technical control we set up camp as other participants showed up.


The next day we said goodbye to Tom and thanked him for all his efforts. Almost all participants had arrived and the field was full of solar bikes and tents. 


At midday there was a reception organized by the domain owners and after a briefing in the afternoon we set off to “place des terraux” in the city center for a public suntrip event. There were a lot of activities there about the suntrip and the Chinese culture.


We had a fun ride back to the campsite together with Jack, including an accidental detour with a nice view over Lyon. As the night fell we were puzzled about some BMS (Battery Management System) issues.




The next day was the first real suntrip day. After another visit and show off at “place des terraux” the prologue was started with the first cycling etappe to a campsite near Aix-les-bains. The ride was super nice, a lot of sunshine and flat roads translated into swift riding. We kept bumping into other participants as everyone was taking similar roads.


When we arrived at the campsite Auguste and I were selected for a photoshoot with our bike at the lakeside, which was quickly followed by a swim in the lake itself.


The next day we cycled to several other suntrip showcase events. In the afternoon we had our first real long climb over a pass with the bike. It was pretty tough and we were rather slow on the steep ascent, being overtaken by a few other suntrippers.
Jack who was riding with us took control over the bluetooth speaker and played some motivational tunes.




For the last cycling etappe of the prologue we rode the next day to chamonix, again together with jack.
On the scenic descent towards the lake of annecy we passed a lot of baffled looking cyclists. We had lunch in Cluses, in front of a supermarket.


In the afternoon we successfully tested our field-weakening phaserunner. The last climb to chamonix was brutal. Just outside of Servoz the slope kicked up so steep that we had to push the bike for a few tens of meters.
Luckily it quickly leveled off and we had a very scenic ride through the chamonix valley.
After a photo session by national geographic journalists we arrived pretty early at the gite booked by the suntrip.
Only 29 of the 45 participants made it in time for dinner at 21 PM.


The program for the last day of the prologue was another public showcase on the town square of chamonix and a cable car ride up the mountain side for a photoshoot with the Mont Blanc and the chamonix valley.
Around noon Auguste’s colleagues arrived by car, carrying some repair/upgrade tools which were promptly put to use after lunch.
