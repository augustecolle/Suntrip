Regulations
-----------

550 Wp / 3.05 m^2  (~180 W/m^2, we want at least this, if not higher if we go below surface area 3.05 m^2 while still maintaining 550 Wp)


Flexible solar panels
---------------------

SunPower, high efficiency, low cost, DIY from individual cells.

Sunpower
--------

Nominal cell power (Hp): 3.41 W 
Nominal cell area: 153.328 cm^2
Max. allowed area: 3.05 m^2
Max. allowed power: 550 Wp
Price/cell (Hp): 2.52 dollar ~ 2.13 euro (exchange rate of 20/12/2017)
Orders come in packs of 150 cells

(Max. allowed area)/(Nominal cell area) = 198 cells (truncated)
(Max. allowed power)/(Nominal cell power) = 161 cells (truncated). Since this is lower than the cells needed to cover the max. area, this means the Hp series (lowest price, least efficiency) qualify for still getting maximum power.
Price for 300 cells: 756.0 dollar
Price for 1200 tabs: 84.0 dollar

Solar cells
------------

12.5 cm x 12.5 cm
550 Wp / 3.41 W = 161 cellen.
161 x (12.5 cm)^2 = 2.515625 m^2

162 cellen
-----------
12.5 cm x  6 = 75.0 cm  ->  80 cm
12.5 cm x 27 = 337.5 cm -> 340 cm
--------------------------------
             = 2.53125 m^2 -> 2.72 m^2 

160 cellen
----------
12.5 cm x  5 = 62.5 cm  ->  67.5 cm
12.5 cm x 32 = 400 cm   -> 402.5 cm

161 cellen
----------
12.5 cm x  7 = 87.5 cm  ->  92.5 cm
12.5 cm x 21 = 262.5 cm -> 265.0 cm
